#  QA Bug Report Practice – Game Testing Portfolio

This mini-repo shows my basic QA/testing skills using JIRA and bug reporting, focused on game testing scenarios.
Includes sample bug reports with priorities, reproduction steps, and expected results.

---

##  Tools Used

- JIRA (Kanban board, issue creation, priorities)
- Markdown (for writing clean reports)
- Manual testing logic (test cases, repro steps)

---

## Sample Bug Reports

### 1.  "Start Game" button not working
**Priority:** High
- **Steps to Reproduce:** Open main menu → Click "Start Game"

##  Summary

This project reflects my QA mindset and ability to identify, prioritize, and report bugs in a structured way using JIRA.
Looking forward to growing in game QA and working with dev teams.
