#  QA Bug Report Practice – Game Testing Portfolio

This mini-repo shows my basic QA/testing skills using JIRA and bug reporting, focused on game testing scenarios.  
Includes sample bug reports with priorities, reproduction steps, and expected results.

##  Tools Used

- JIRA (Kanban board, issue creation, priorities)
- Markdown (for writing clean reports)
- Manual testing logic (test cases, repro steps)
